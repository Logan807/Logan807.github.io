                    I am a web and graphic designer in New Hampshire, 
                    currently enrolled in F.I.R.S.T. Institute's Graphic Design and 
                    Web Development program to grow my skills.
                    I bring a unique and flexible design style, and value style, 
                    user experience, and usability based on my experiences 
                    with video games, where such considerations are imperative 
                    and often a good indicator for overall quality.
                    I am proficient in Adobe Photoshop, familiar with 
                    Illustrator and Animate, and am currently learning HTML and CSS. 
                    I also occaisionally dabble in video editing in 
                    Premiere and After Effects. I enjoy working in these programs, 
                    and work hard to make things others will enjoy.
