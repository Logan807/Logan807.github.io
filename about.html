                I am a web and graphic designer in New Hampshire, 
                currently enrolled in F.I.R.S.T. Institute's Graphic Design and 
                Web Development program to grow my skills.
                I bring a unique and flexible design style, and value 
                user experience and usability based on my experiences 
                with video games, where such considerations are imperative 
                and often a good indicator for overall quality.
                I am proficient in Adobe Photoshop, and familiar with 
                Illustrator, Animate, and am currently learning HTML and CSS. 
                I also occaisionally dabble in video editing in 
                Premiere and After Effects.
