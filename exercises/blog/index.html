                    'My Brother's Keeper', the Easter Egg for Der Eisendrache,
                    is regarded as the easiest easter egg in Black Ops 3,
                    but it still takes some effort. This guide will take you through
                    the necessary steps to complete the egg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, one bow must be upgraded per player. For example, 
                    if there is one player in the game, only one bow must 
                    be upgraded, and if there are three players in the game, 
                    three bows must be upgraded. In a non-ranked private game, 
                    however, all bows must be upgraded. The Ragnarok DG4 
                    must also be built, and the Death Ray must be used at least 
                    once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To begin the easter egg, a player must shoot the top of the 
                    teleporter with the unupgraded Wrath of the Ancients, 
                    turning the ends orange and making a growling sound when 
                    all have been shot. Once this is done, a wisp will spawn in 
                    one of eight set locations, which will need to be shot four 
                    times with an upgraded bow within a limited amount of time. 
                    After each wisp is shot, a new one will appear, without 
                    repeating locations. If the wisp is not shot in time or 
                    shot with an unupgraded bow, an alarm will sound, 
                    signifying the failure, and you must retry the next round.
                    <br>
                    The locations for the wisps are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Phone in the small office with Quick Revive.</li>
                    <li>Truck tire near Double Tap II.</li>
                    <li>
                        Box near work bench above Double Tap on the way to the Wundersphere.
                    </li>
                    <li>Globe in the small room beside Samantha's room.</li>
                    <li>
                        Phone on pillar near power switch, 
                        same pillar as the Bowie Knife, but opposite side.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clock in the hallway connecting the Clock Tower 
                        (Radio Room) and Church (Mission Control), 
                        referred to as the Barracks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Radio in the adjacent corner from Speed Cola 
                        inside the Church (the one close to the entrance)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clock above fireplace in the Church (Mission Control)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <img 
                    id="clock" 
                    src="images/terminal-clock.jpeg" 
                    alt="The terminal near the clock tower"
                >
                <p>
                    Once the wisps have all been shot, signified by a sound cue, 
                    all players must return to the teleporter, which is now 
                    glowing purple, to teleport to the past. Here, players are 
                       unable to use their weapons, but don't worry. No zombies 
                    spawn here, and all that happens is Dr. Groph talking to 
                    Richtofen and using a safe. Two objects must be picked up here: 
                    a large blue canister to the left, and some fuses to the right. 
                    The three symbol code Dr. Groph enters into the safe must also 
                    be remembered. After returning to the present, the Death Ray 
                    must be interacted with to put the fuses into it, and the 
                    lever on the other side must be flipped from "Destroy" to 
                    "Protect". The code from the past must now be entered in the 
                    terminal near the clock tower, opening the safe in the teleporter 
                    room, where larger fuses and a keycard are picked up. These steps 
                    from shooting the wisps to here must be done in the same round, 
                    and must be restarted in the next round if failed.
                </p>
                <img 
                    id="rocket"
                    src="images/terminal-rocket.jpeg" 
                    alt="The terminal at the rocket pad"
                >
                <p>
                    Return to the Death Ray, and put the large fuses into the 
                    tesla coils on either side, and flip the lever back to "Destroy". 
                    Go to and interact with one of the terminals. Four symbols 
                    will be shown for a brief time before disapearing, and a 
                    symbol will show up on the large screen on top. The player 
                    must interact with the screen that showed that symbol. 
                    This must be done several times, and can be retried as many 
                    times as needed. After the first terminal is done, the 
                    second terminal must be interacted with in the same way. 
                    After this, the orbs atop the tesla coils will glow, and 
                    the button on the back of the Death Ray will glow, and 
                    must be pressed to send a rocket crashing to the upper 
                    courtyard. Next to the rocket is the Vril Device that must 
                    be picked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, travel back in time using the same method as before, this 
                    time using the computer to insert the keycard and open the box 
                    where a stone tablet is picked up. In the crypt, place the 
                    Vril Device into the pyramid to spawn a Keeper. The Keeper will 
                    go to four spots in a randomized order, and a circle will appear 
                    that players will need to stand in while killing zombies to 
                    fill the nearby tablets. When in the circle, the edges of the 
                    screen will glow in a color related to the upgraded bow the 
                    player must use to kill the zombies. At the location near 
                    Double Tap, the tablet must be placed in the hole in the 
                    wall to spawn the circle. After all the tablets have been filled, 
                    the Keeper will return to the pyramid and teleport to the 
                    moon, eventually teleporting the MPD in place of the pyramid. 
                    Place the canister in the missing slot on the corner of the 
                    MPD, opening it to reveal the now corrupted Keeper. 
                    It is recommended to prepare extensively before continuing, 
                    as this is the point of no return. To enter the boss battle, 
                    each player must place their Ragnarok DG4 on one of the tiles 
                    surrounding the MPD.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Keeper has several attacks, and zombies will also spawn 
                    during the battle. The Keeper can summon skulls to target players, 
                    skeletons that act like zombies but can be harder to see, 
                    glowing mounds that do heavy damage to the player, 
                    and an electric shockwave that instantly downs anyone not 
                    hiding behind the pillars in the arena, announced by a ball of 
                    electricity building beneath the Keeper.
                    To damage the Keeper, wait until a ball of electricity appears 
                    underneath the Keeper, then plant the DG4 inside the ball 
                    to trap the Keeper and expose its weak spot, a glowing hole in 
                    its chest which must be shot. This must be done three times, 
                    with Panzer Soldats spawning in between each phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the defeat of the Keeper, the players will be teleported 
                    back to the MPD. Interacting with it will spawn the Summoning 
                    Key which must be picked up and taken to the terminal near the 
                    clock tower. Interacting with the terminal will cause several 
                    rockets will be launched towards the moon, destroying it. 
                    Return to where the moon-rocket crashed, and the final 
                    cutscene will start playing.
