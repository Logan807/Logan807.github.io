        <p>
            <b>Graphic design</b> is a <a href="#">profession</a>,
            <sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup> <a href="#">academic discipline</a>
            <sup><a href="#">[3]</a><a href="#">[4]</a><a href="#">[5]</a></sup> 
            and <a href="#">applied art</a> whose activity consists in 
            projecting <a href="#">visual communications</a> intended to 
            transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific 
            objectives.<sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup> Graphic design is an 
            interdisciplinary branch of <a href="#">design</a>
            <sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup> and of the fine arts. 
            Its practice involves <a href="#">creativity</a>, 
            <a href="#">innovation</a> and <a href="#">lateral thinking</a> 
            using manual or <a href="#">digital tools</a>, where it is usual 
            to use text and graphics to communicate visually.

        <p>
            The role of the <a href="#">graphic designer</a> 
            in the communication process is that of encoder or interpreter 
            of the message. They work on the interpretation, ordering, 
            and presentation of visual messages. Usually, graphic design 
            uses the <a href="#">aesthetics</a> of <a href="#">typography</a> 
            and the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, 
            and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what 
            language alone expresses. The design work can be based on 
            a customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established 
            linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, 
            that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a 
            graphic manifestation.<sup><a href="#">[7]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas 
            of knowledge focused on any visual communication system. 
            For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, 
            or it can also be applied in the <a href="#">aviation world</a>
            <sup><a href="#">[8]</a></sup> or <a href="#">space exploration</a>.
            <sup><a href="#">[9]</a><a href="#">[10]</a></sup> 
            In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as 
            only associated with the production of sketches and drawings, 
            this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a 
            huge range of types and classes where it can be applied.

        <p>
            With origins in <a href="#">Antiquity</a> and the 
            <a href="#">Middle Ages</a>,<sup><a href="#">[11]</a></sup> 
            graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the 
            boom of <a href="#">rise of printing</a> in Europe in the 
            15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the 
            <a href="#">Industrial Revolution</a>. From there it emerged as a 
            distinct profession in the West, closely associated with 
            <a href="#">advertising</a> in the 19th century
            <sup><a href="#">[12]</a></sup> and its evolution allowed its 
            consolidation in the 20th century. Given the rapid and massive 
            growth in information exchange today, the demand for experienced 
            designers is greater than ever, particularly because of the 
            development of new technologies and the need to pay attention to 
            human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who 
            develop them.<sup><a href="#">[13]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="#">William Addison Dwiggins</a> is often credited with 
            first using the term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,
            <sup><a href="#">[14]</a></sup> although it appears in a 4 July 1908 
            issue (volume 9, number 27) of Organized Labor, a publication of the 
            Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article about technical education 
            for printers:<sup><a href="#">[15]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
           An Enterprising Trades Union
           <br> 
           … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails 
           among printers is an assurance that with the elemental 
           principles of design at their finger ends many of them 
           will grow in knowledge and develop into specialists in 
           graphic design and decorating. …
        </p>

        <p>
            A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the 
            <a href="#">California School of Arts & Crafts</a> advertised a 
            course titled Graphic Design and Lettering, which replaced one 
            called Advanced Design and Lettering. Both classes were taught by 
            <a href="#">Frederick Meyer</a>.<sup><a href="#">[16]</a></sup>

        <p><i>Main article: <a href="#">History of graphic design</a></i></p>
        <p>
            In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion 
            of <a href="#">visual communication</a> in the 20th and 21st centuries, 
            the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art 
            has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, 
            practices, <a href="#">languages</a> and sometimes the same benefactor 
            or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods 
            and services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to 
            information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that 
            document the human experience."<sup><a href="#">[17]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <h3>The advent of printing</h3>
        <p><i>Main article: <a href="#">History of printing</a></i></p>

        <p>
            In China, during the <a href="#">Tang dynasty</a> (618–907) 
            wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce 
            Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the 
            earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century in China, 
            longer scrolls and books were produced using 
            <a href="#">movable type</a> printing, making books widely available 
            during the <a href="#">Song dynasty</a> 
            (960–1279).<sup><a href="#">[18]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <h3>Nineteenth century</h3>

        <p>
            In 1849, <a href="#">Henry Cole</a> became one of the major forces 
            in <a href="#">design education</a> in Great Britain, 
            informing the government of the importance of design in his 
            <i>Journal of Design and Manufactures</i>. He organized the 
            <a href="#">Great Exhibition</a> as a celebration of modern 
            industrial technology and Victorian design.
        </p>

        <p>
            From 1891 to 1896, <a href="#">William Morris</a>' 
            <a href="#">Kelmscott Press</a> was a leader in graphic design 
            associated with the <a href="#">Arts and Crafts movement</a>, 
            creating hand-made books in medieval and Renaissance era style,
            <sup><a href="#">[21]</a></sup> in addition to wallpaper and 
            textile designs.<sup><a href="#">[22]</a></sup> Morris' work, 
            along with the rest of the <a href="#">Private Press</a> movement, 
            directly influenced Art Nouveau.<sup><a href="#">[23]</a></sup>

        <p>
            <a href="#">Will H. Bradley</a> became one of the notable 
            graphic designers in the late nineteenth-century due to creating 
            art pieces in various Art Nouveau styles. Bradley created a number 
            of designs as promotions for a literary magazine titled 
            <i>The Chap-Book</i>.<sup><a href="#">[24]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <h3>Twentieth century</h3>

        <p>
            In 1917, <a href="#">Frederick H. Meyer</a>, director and 
            instructor at the <a href="#">California School of Arts and Crafts</a>, 
            taught a class entitled "Graphic Design and Lettering".
            <sup><a href="#">[25]</a></sup> Raffe's <i>Graphic Design</i>, 
            published in 1927, was the first book to use "Graphic Design" 
            in its title.<sup><a href="#">[26]</a></sup> In 1936, author and 
            graphic designer Leon Friend published his book titled "Graphic Design" 
            and it is known to be the first piece of literature to cover the topic 
            extensively.<sup><a href="#">[27]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            The signage in the <a href="#">London Underground</a> is a 
            classic design example<sup><a href="#">[28]</a></sup> of the 
            <a href="#">modern era</a>. Although he lacked artistic training, 
            <a href="#">Frank Pick</a> led the Underground Group design and 
            publicity movement. The first Underground station signs were 
            introduced in 1908 with a design of a solid red disk with a 
            blue bar in the center and the name of the station. 
            The station name was in white sans-serif letters. It was in 1916 
            when Pick used the expertise of <a href="#">Edward Johnston</a> 
            to design a new typeface for the Underground. Johnston redesigned 
            the Underground sign and logo to include his typeface on the blue bar 
            in the center of a red circle.<sup><a href="#">[29]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            In the 1920s, Soviet <a href="#">constructivism</a> applied 
            'intellectual production' in different spheres of production. 
            The movement saw individualistic art as useless in revolutionary 
            Russia and thus moved towards creating objects for 
            <a href="#">utilitarian</a> purposes. They designed buildings, 
            theater sets, posters, fabrics, clothing, furniture, 
            logos, menus, etc.<sup><a href="#">[30]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="#">Jan Tschichold</a> codified the principles of 
            <a href="#">modern typography</a> in his 1928 book, 
            <i>New Typography</i>.<sup><a href="#">[31]</a></sup> 
            He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as 
            fascistic, but it remained influential.
            <a href="#">[<i>citation needed</i>]</a> Tschichold, 
            <a href="#">Bauhaus</a> typographers such as 
            <a href="#">Herbert Bayer</a> and <a href="#">László Moholy-Nagy</a> 
            and <a href="#">El Lissitzky</a> greatly influenced graphic design. 
            They pioneered production techniques
            <a href="#">[<i>citation needed</i>]</a> and stylistic devices used 
            throughout the twentieth century. The following years saw 
            graphic design in the modern style gain widespread acceptance and 
            application.<sup><a href="#">[32]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            The professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with 
            <a href="#">consumerism</a>. This raised concerns and criticisms, 
            notably from within the graphic design community with the 
            <a href="#">First Things First manifesto</a>. First launched by 
            <a href="#">Ken Garland</a> in 1964, it was re-published as the 
            <a href="#">First Things First 2000 manifesto</a> in 1999 in the 
            magazine <i><a href="#">Emigre</a></i> 51
            <sup><a href="#">[33]</a></sup> stating "We propose a reversal of 
            priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms 
            of communication – a mindshift away from product marketing and 
            toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. 
            The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is 
            running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives 
            expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of 
            design."<sup><a href="#">[34]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>
            Graphic design can have many applications, from 
            <a href="#">road signs</a> to technical schematics and 
            reference <a href="#">manuals</a>. It is often used in 
            branding products and elements of company identity such as 
            logos, colors, <a href="#">packaging</a>, 
            <a href="#">labelling</a> and text.
        </p>

        <p>
            From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of 
            opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and 
            thoughtful compositions of visual information – known as 
            <a href="#">information design</a>. With the advent of the web, 
            information designers with experience in interactive tools are 
            increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. 
            Information design can include 
            <a href="#">Data and information visualization</a>, 
            which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a 
            visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with 
            <a href="#">information graphics</a>.

            The "process school" is concerned with communication; 
            it highlights the channels and media through which messages 
            are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and 
            decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a 
            construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, 
            produces meaning; communication as an 
            agent.<sup><a href="#">[<i>citation needed</i>]</a></sup>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <p><i>Main article: <a href="#">Typography</a></i></p>

        <p>
            Typography includes type design, modifying type 
            <a href="#">glyphs</a> and arranging type. Type glyphs 
            (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. 
            Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking 
            (the space between all characters used), kerning 
            (the space between two specific characters) and leading 
            (line spacing).
        </p>

        <p>
            Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, 
            graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the 
            digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts 
            communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 
            1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a 
            vintage report.<sup><a href="#">[35]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <h3>Page Layout</h3>
        <p><i>Further information: <a href="#">Grid (graphic design)</a></i></p>

        <p>
            Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a 
            page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design 
            has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently 
            extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of 
            <a href="#">type</a> (text), <a href="#">images</a> (pictures), and 
            (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a 
            <a href="#">dieline</a> for elements that are not printed with ink 
            such as <a href="#">die/laser cutting</a>, 
            <a href="#">foil stamping</a> or <a href="#">blind embossing</a>.

        <h3>Grids</h3>

        <p>
            A grid serves as a method of arranging both space and information, 
            allowing the reader to easily comprehend the overall project. 
            Furthermore, a grid functions as a container for information and a 
            means of establishing and maintaining order. Despite grids being 
            utilized for centuries, many graphic designers associate them with 
            Swiss design. The desire for order in the 1940s resulted in a highly 
            systematic approach to visualizing information. However, grids were 
            later regarded as tedious and uninteresting, earning the label of 
            "designersaur." Today, grids are once again considered crucial tools 
            for professionals, whether they are novices or veterans.
