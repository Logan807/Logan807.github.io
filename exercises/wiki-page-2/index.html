        <p>
            <b>Graphic design</b> is a <a href="#">profession</a>,
            <sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup> <a href="#">academic discipline</a>
            <sup><a href="#">[3]</a><a href="#">[4]</a><a href="#">[5]</a></sup> 
            and <a href="#">applied art</a> whose activity consists in 
            projecting <a href="#">visual communications</a> intended to 
            transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific 
            objectives.<sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup> Graphic design is an 
            interdisciplinary branch of <a href="#">design</a>
            <sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup> and of the fine arts. 
            Its practice involves <a href="#">creativity</a>, 
            <a href="#">innovation</a> and <a href="#">lateral thinking</a> 
            using manual or <a href="#">digital tools</a>, where it is usual 
            to use text and graphics to communicate visually.

        <p>
            The role of the <a href="#">graphic designer</a> 
            in the communication process is that of encoder or interpreter 
            of the message. They work on the interpretation, ordering, 
            and presentation of visual messages. Usually, graphic design 
            uses the <a href="#">aesthetics</a> of <a href="#">typography</a> 
            and the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, 
            and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what 
            language alone expresses. The design work can be based on 
            a customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established 
            linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, 
            that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a 
            graphic manifestation.<sup><a href="#">[7]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas 
            of knowledge focused on any visual communication system. 
            For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, 
            or it can also be applied in the <a href="#">aviation world</a>
            <sup><a href="#">[8]</a></sup> or <a href="#">space exploration</a>.
            <sup><a href="#">[9]</a><a href="#">[10]</a></sup> 
            In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as 
            only associated with the production of sketches and drawings, 
            this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a 
            huge range of types and classes where it can be applied.

            With origins in <a href="#">Antiquity</a> and the 
            <a href="#">Middle Ages</a>,<sup><a href="#">[11]</a></sup> 
            graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the 
            boom of <a href="#">rise of printing</a> in Europe in the 
            15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the 
            <a href="#">Industrial Revolution</a>. From there it emerged as a 
            distinct profession in the West, closely associated with 
            <a href="#">advertising</a> in the 19th century
            <sup><a href="#">[12]</a></sup> and its evolution allowed its 
            consolidation in the 20th century. Given the rapid and massive 
            growth in information exchange today, the demand for experienced 
            designers is greater than ever, particularly because of the 
            development of new technologies and the need to pay attention to 
            human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who 
            develop them.<sup><a href="#">[13]</a></sup>

            <a href="#">William Addison Dwiggins</a> is often credited with 
            first using the term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,
            <sup><a href="#">[14]</a></sup> although it appears in a 4 July 1908 
            issue (volume 9, number 27) of Organized Labor, a publication of the 
            Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article about technical education 
            for printers:<sup><a href="#">[15]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
           An Enterprising Trades Union
           <br> 
           … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails 
           among printers is an assurance that with the elemental 
           principles of design at their finger ends many of them 
           will grow in knowledge and develop into specialists in 
           graphic design and decorating. …
        </p>

        <p>
            A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the 
            <a href="#">California School of Arts & Crafts</a> advertised a 
            course titled Graphic Design and Lettering, which replaced one 
            called Advanced Design and Lettering. Both classes were taught by 
            <a href="#">Frederick Meyer</a>.<sup><a href="#">[16]</a></sup>

        <p>
            In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion 
            of <a href="#">visual communication</a> in the 20th and 21st centuries, 
            the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art 
            has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, 
            practices, <a href="#">languages</a> and sometimes the same benefactor 
            or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods 
            and services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to 
            information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that 
            document the human experience."<sup><a href="#">[17]</a></sup>

        <h3>The advent of printing</h3>
        <p><i>Main article: <a href="#">History of printing</a></i></p>

        <p>
            In China, during the <a href="#">Tang dynasty</a> (618–907) 
            wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce 
            Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the 
            earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century in China, 
            longer scrolls and books were produced using 
            <a href="#">movable type</a> printing, making books widely available 
            during the <a href="#">Song dynasty</a> 
            (960–1279).<sup><a href="#">[18]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <h3>Nineteenth century</h3>

        <p>
            In 1849, <a href="#">Henry Cole</a> became one of the major forces 
            in <a href="#">design education</a> in Great Britain, 
            informing the government of the importance of design in his 
            Journal of Design and Manufactures. He organized the 
            <a href="#">Great Exhibition</a> as a celebration of modern 
            industrial technology and Victorian design.

        <p>
            From 1891 to 1896, <a href="#">William Morris</a>' 
            <a href="#">Kelmscott Press</a> was a leader in graphic design 
            associated with the <a href="#">Arts and Crafts movement</a>, 
            creating hand-made books in medieval and Renaissance era style,
            <sup><a href="#">[21]</a></sup> in addition to wallpaper and 
            textile designs.<sup><a href="#">[22]</a></sup> Morris' work, 
            along with the rest of the <a href="#">Private Press</a> movement, 
            directly influenced Art Nouveau.<sup><a href="#">[23]</a></sup>

        <p>
            <a href="#">Will H. Bradley</a> became one of the notable 
            graphic designers in the late nineteenth-century due to creating 
            art pieces in various Art Nouveau styles. Bradley created a number 
            of designs as promotions for a literary magazine titled 
            The Chap-Book.<sup><a href="#">[24]</a></sup>

        <h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>
            Graphic design can have many applications, from road signs to technical schematics and reference manuals. It is often used in branding products and elements of company identity such as logos, colors, packaging, labelling and text.
