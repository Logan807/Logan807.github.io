                            The Dodge Viper is a sports car that was manufactured by Dodge 
                            (by SRT for 2013 and 2014), a division of American car 
                            manufacturer FCA US LLC from 1992 until 2017, having taken a 
                            brief hiatus in 2007, and from 2010 to 2012. Production of the 
                            two-seat sports car began at New Mack Assembly Plant in 1991 
                            and moved to Conner Avenue Assembly Plant in October 1995.

                            Although Chrysler considered ending production because of 
                            serious financial problems,<sup>[1][2]</sup> on 
                            September 14, 2010, then-chief executive Sergio Marchionne 
                            announced and previewed a new model of the Viper for 2012.
                            <sup>[3]</sup> In 2014, the Viper was named number 10 
                            on the "Most American Cars" list, meaning 75% or more of 
                            its parts are manufactured in the U.S.<sup>[4]</sup> 
                            The Viper was eventually discontinued in 2017 after 
                            approximately 32,000 were produced over the 26 years of 
                            production.<sup>[5][6]</sup>

                            The 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time on a Viper varies from 
                            around 3.5 to 4.5 seconds. Top speed ranges from 
                            160 mph (260 km/h) to over 200 mph (320 km/h), depending 
                            on variant and year.<sup>[7]</sup>

                <p>
                    The Viper was initially conceived in late 1988 at 
                    Chrysler's Advanced Design Studios. The following 
                    February, Chrysler president Bob Lutz suggested to 
                    Tom Gale at Chrysler Design Center that the company 
                    should consider producing a modern Cobra, and a 
                    clay model was presented to Lutz a few months later. 
                    Produced in sheet metal by Metalcrafters,<sup>[8]</sup> 
                    the car appeared as a concept at the North American 
                    International Auto Show in 1989. Public reaction was so 
                    enthusiastic that chief engineer Roy Sjoberg was directed 
                    to develop it as a standard production vehicle. But then 
                    Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca delayed approving the 
                    $70 million needed to put the sports car into production, 
                    saying it was a lot to spend without assurance of 
                    financial return.<sup>[9]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sjoberg selected 85 engineers to be "Team Viper", 
                    with development beginning in March 1989. The team asked 
                    the then-Chrysler subsidiary Lamborghini to cast a prototype 
                    aluminum block for the sports car to use in May. The production 
                    body was completed in Fall 1989, with a chassis prototype 
                    running in December. Though a V8 engine was first used in the 
                    test mule called White Mule, the V10 engine, which the 
                    production car was meant to use, was ready in February 1990. 
                    Official approval from Iacocca came in May 1990. By 
                    auto industry standards $70 million was not a lot of money 
                    but the potential in improved image was fantastic. One year 
                    later, Carroll Shelby piloted a pre-production car as the pace 
                    vehicle in the Indianapolis 500 race.<sup>[10]</sup> 
                    In November 1991, the car was released to reviewers with the 
                    first retail shipments beginning in January 1992.

                    The powerful two-seater, which sold for $52,000, sparked 
                    immediate interest in the Dodge brand among enthusiasts and 
                    the automotive press.<sup>[11]</sup> Lutz hoped it would raise 
                    the spirits of the designers and engineers who were discouraged 
                    by the homely, unpopular cars that they had been commanded 
                    to produce.<sup>[11]</sup> The popularity of the Viper 
                    overshadowed the recent failure of Iacocca's pet car, the TC, 
                    which had cost five times as much to develop.<sup>[11]</sup>

                            The first prototype was tested in January 1989. 
                            It debuted in 1991 with two pre-production models 
                            as the pace car for the Indianapolis 500 when Dodge was 
                            forced to substitute it in place of the Japanese-built 
                            Dodge Stealth, because of complaints from the 
                            United Auto Workers, and went on sale in January 1992 
                            as the RT/10 Roadster.<sup>[12]</sup>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lamborghini (then owned by Chrysler Corporation) helped 
                            with the design of the V10 engine for the Viper, which was 
                            based on the Chrysler's LA V8 engine. A major contributor to 
                            the Viper since the beginning was Dick Winkles, the 
                            chief power engineer, who had spent time in Italy 
                            overseeing the development of the engine.<sup>[13]</sup>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Originally engineered to be a performance car, the Viper had 
                            no exterior-mounted door handles or key cylinders and 
                            no air conditioning (however, this was added as an option for 
                            the 1994-95 models, and climate controls featured a "snowflake" 
                            icon, which indicated a potential setting for the A/C). 
                            The roof was made from canvas, and the windows were made 
                            from vinyl using zippers to open and close, much like the 
                            Jeep Wrangler. However, the Viper was still equipped with 
                            some domestic features, including manually-adjustable 
                            leather-trimmed sport bucket seats with lumbar support, 
                            an AM/FM stereo cassette player with clock and high fidelity 
                            sound system, and interior carpeting. Aluminium alloy wheels 
                            were larger in diameter due to the larger brakes. 
                            A lightweight fiberglass hard roof option on later models 
                            was also available to cover the canvas soft roof, and was 
                            shipped with each new car. There were also no airbags, in the 
                            interest of weight reduction. Adjustable performance 
                            suspension was also an available option for most Vipers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The engine weighs 323 kg (712 lb) and is rated at 400 hp 
                            (406 PS; 298 kW) at 4,600 rpm and 630 N⋅m (465 lb⋅ft) of 
                            torque at 3,600 rpm. Due to the long-gearing allowed by 
                            the engine, it provides fuel economy at a United States 
                            Environmental Protection Agency-rated 12 mpg‑<sub>US</sub> 
                            (20 L/100 km; 14 mpg‑<sub>imp</sub>) in the city and 20 mpg‑<sub>US</sub> 
                            (12 L/100 km; 24 mpg‑<sub>imp</sub>) on the highway.[14] The body is a 
                            tubular steel frame with resin transfer molding (RTM) 
                            fiberglass panels. The car has a curb weight of 1,490 kg 
                            (3,280 lb) and lacks modern driver aids such as 
                            traction control and anti-lock brakes. The SR I can accelerate 
                            from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 4.2 seconds, 0–161 km/h 
                            (0–100 mph) in 9.2 seconds, can complete the quarter mile in 
                            12.6 seconds at the speed of 183.1 km/h (113.8 mph) and has a 
                            maximum speed of approximately 266 km/h (165 mph).
                            <sup>[15][16]</sup> Its large tires allow the car to 
                            average close to one lateral g in corners. However, the car 
                            proves tricky to drive at high speeds, particularly for the 
                            unskilled driver.

                            two large central tailpipes during the middle of the model year, 
                            which reduced back pressure, and therefore increased the power 
                            to 415 hp (309 kW; 421 PS). Torque would also increase by 
                            23 lb⋅ft (31 N⋅m) to 488 lb⋅ft (662 N⋅m). A removable hardtop 
                            was now available along with a sliding glass window. 
                            Some steel suspension components were replaced by aluminum, 
                            resulting in a 60 lb (27 kg) weight reduction.<sup>[17]</sup>

                            taking cues from the Dodge Viper GTS-R concept presented in 2000. 
                            The new Viper SRT-10, which replaced both the GTS and the RT/10, 
                            was heavily restyled with sharp, angled bodywork. 
                            The engine's displacement was increased to 8.3 L; 505.6 cu in 
                            (8,285 cc), which, with other upgrades, increased the 
                            maximum power output to 500 hp (507 PS; 373 kW) at 5,600 rpm 
                            and 525 lb⋅ft (712 N⋅m) of torque at 4,200 rpm.<sup>[21]</sup> 
                            Despite the power increase, the engine weight was reduced to 
                            about 500 lb (230 kg). The chassis was also improved, 
                            becoming more rigid and weighing approximately 80 lb (36 kg) 
                            less than the previous model.

                    In 2008, with the introduction of the 8,382 cc 
                    (8.4 L; 511.5 cu in) V10 engine, the power output was raised 
                    from 500 hp (507 PS; 373 kW) to 600 hp (608 PS; 447 kW) 
                    at 6,100 rpm and 560 lb⋅ft (759 N⋅m) of torque at 5,000 rpm. 
                    The engine also received better flowing heads with larger valves, 
                    MECADYNE cam-in-cam variable valve timing on the 
                    exhaust cam lobes, and dual electronic throttle bodies.
                    <sup>[25][26]</sup> The rev limit could be increased by 
                    300 rpm due to the improved valvetrain stability from both the 
                    new camshaft profiles and valve springs. The engine was developed 
                    with some external assistance from McLaren Automotive and 
                    Ricardo Consulting Engineers. Electronic engine control was 
                    developed by Continental AG; the controller can monitor the 
                    crankshaft and cylinder position up to six times during each 
                    firing and has 10 times more processing power than the 
                    previous unit.

                <p>
                    In 1996, a race car based on the Viper was built, 
                    and was called the Chrysler Viper GTS-R 
                    (in American races, was named the Dodge Viper GTS-R). 
                    The construction was done by Chrysler and by the teams 
                    Reynard Motorsport and Oreca. The numbers the car used were 
                    vast, with numbers like #91, #51, #2, #92, and #52.

                <p>
                    A new race car called the Viper Competition Coupe took the 
                    GTS-R's place for the second phase. The Viper Competition Coupe 
                    had the same 8.3-liter V10 engine as the road legal Viper, 
                    but increased power to 520 hp (388 kW; 527 PS), 
                    and 540 lb⋅ft (732 N⋅m) of torque.[81] The Competition Coupe had 
                    a carbon fiber composite body on a tubular steel frame with no 
                    interior trim and an FIA-legal roll cage. The exterior design 
                    of the Competition Coupe was based on the Viper GTS-R concept 
                    from 2000. Modifications to the mechanicals of the Viper 
                    included a 27-gallon fuel cell, differential cooler, 
                    ducted brakes, improved driver and engine cooling, trap door 
                    oil pan, low-inertia flywheel, an improved double-wishbone 
                    suspension system, new spherical bearing control arm attachments, 
                    two-way adjustable coil over dampers, and a driver-adjustable 
                    blade-type rear anti-roll bar. The anti-lock braking system 
                    added a distribution control system.<sup>[82]</sup> 
                    The initial price of the car is around $100,000.<sup>[82]</sup>

                    The GTS-R returned in competition, but this time as an 
                    LM GTE class race car and instead, was constructed and 
                    designed by SRT Motorsports and Riley Technologies. 
                    It includes Michelin GT tires. The car retained the number 
                    #91 but had a new number for it called #93.

                    The Viper GT3-R was made available for race teams in the later half 
                    of 2013 at an estimated cost of $459,000.<sup>[87]</sup> The car shares 
                    many technologies with the GTE race car but it is built to Group GT3 
                    regulations.
